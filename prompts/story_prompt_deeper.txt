**DEEPER STRATEGY RULES:**

**Enhanced Filipino Language Authenticity:**
- PRIORITIZE authentic Tagalog expressions over English equivalents
- Use PURE Tagalog spelling: "asukal" not "azúcar", "porke" not "porque", "syempre" not "siempre"
- Generate sophisticated Tagalog collocations that native speakers actually use
- Use natural "po/opo" patterns appropriate to social context and formality
- Incorporate Filipino cultural nuances and indirect communication styles

**Strategic English Reduction:**
- English allowed ONLY for complex concepts that need clarification
- Narrator explanations can use English for cultural context
- Dialogues should be predominantly Tagalog with minimal English mixing
- When English is used, it should feel natural to Filipino code-switching patterns

**Language Complexity Enhancement:**
- Use more sophisticated grammatical structures (pero, kahit, kasi, etc.)
- Include culturally authentic expressions and idioms
- Demonstrate natural Filipino conversational flow and rhythm
- Incorporate respectful language patterns (honorifics, indirect requests)

**Voice Assignment Rules:**
- Male names (Carlos, Juan, Miguel) → TAGALOG-MALE voices
- Female names (Maria, Ana, Rosa) → TAGALOG-FEMALE voices
- Maintain consistent character voices throughout lesson

**Number Usage:**
- NEVER use raw digits - always spell out numbers
- Spanish numbers for time: "alas otso y medya" 
- Tagalog numbers for counting: "sampu", "dalawa"
- Use context-appropriate number systems

**Instructions:**
Generate a structured language learning lesson that builds upon Day {source_day} content with enhanced language complexity. Follow the exact format below:

**SECTION 1: Title and Key Phrases**
1. Start with: [NARRATOR]: Day {phase}: {focus} – Day {source_day} Revisited
2. Add a blank line, then "Key Phrases:"
3. For each key phrase/collocation (3-5 maximum for DEEPER strategy):
   - [TAGALOG-FEMALE-1]: [sophisticated phrase in Tagalog]
   - [NARRATOR]: [English translation]
   - [TAGALOG-FEMALE-1]: [phrase again]
   - [syllable breakdown lines - break ONLY Tagalog words at natural boundaries]
   - Blank line before next phrase

**SECTION 2: Natural Speed Dialogue**
1. Add: [NARRATOR]: Natural Speed
2. Create 4-6 sophisticated dialogue scenes (enhanced from source day content)
3. Use authentic Filipino conversation patterns with minimal English
4. Include cultural nuances and indirect communication styles
5. Each scene should demonstrate advanced language structures

**SECTION 3: Slow Speed**
1. Add: [NARRATOR]: Slow Speed  
2. Repeat the exact same dialogues with ellipses (...) between words

**SECTION 4: Translated**
1. Add: [NARRATOR]: Translated
2. Repeat each dialogue scene with alternating lines:
   - [SPEAKER]: [Original Tagalog line]
   - [NARRATOR]: [English translation with cultural context when needed]

**Content Guidelines:**
- Build upon themes from Day {source_day} with enhanced sophistication
- Use 90%+ dialogue with authentic Filipino conversational patterns
- Incorporate ALL provided review collocations naturally
- Introduce fewer but more sophisticated new collocations
- Demonstrate respectful and culturally appropriate interactions
- Focus on natural Filipino expressions rather than literal English translations

**Cultural Authenticity Examples:**

**Basic Level (Day {source_day}):** 
"Excuse me, where is the bathroom?"
"Saan po ang CR?"

**DEEPER Level (Current):**
"Paumanhin po, saan kaya ang palikuran dito?"
(More formal, uses "kaya" for politeness, "palikuran" instead of "CR")

**Basic Level:**
"How much is this?"
"Magkano po ito?"

**DEEPER Level:**
"Paumanhin po, ano pong presyo nito?"
(More formal opening, "presyo" instead of "magkano" for sophisticated register)
