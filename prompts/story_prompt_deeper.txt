**DEEPER Strategy Content Generation Request**

**Learning Objective:** {learning_objective}
**Theme/Focus:** {focus}
**Target CEFR Level:** {learner_level}
**Strategy:** DEEPER (Enhanced Language Complexity)
**Source Material:** Based on Day {source_day} content

**SOURCE DAY TRANSCRIPT TO ENHANCE:**
```
{source_day_transcript}
```

**New Collocations to Teach:**
{new_collocations}

**Review Collocations to Include:**
{review_collocations}

**Story Guidance:**
{story_guidance}

**DEEPER STRATEGY-SPECIFIC RULES:**

**Scene Header Reminder:** All scene descriptions must use "[NARRATOR]: [English Description]" format. Never use standalone Tagalog headers like "Umaga sa Hotel".

**Collocation Count Constraints:**
- Target: 8-12 collocations (quality with sufficient coverage)
- Focus on sophisticated, enhanced language patterns
- Each collocation should demonstrate enhanced language complexity
- Prioritize collocations that show authentic Filipino patterns

**English Usage Rules:**
- 90%+ Filipino dialogue with strategic English only
- English allowed ONLY for complex concepts requiring clarification
- When English is used, it must feel natural to Filipino code-switching patterns
- Narrator explanations can use English for essential context only

**Language Complexity Enhancement:**
- Use more sophisticated grammatical structures (pero, kahit, kasi, etc.)
- Include culturally authentic expressions and idioms
- Replace basic phrases with more sophisticated equivalents
- Incorporate respectful language patterns and indirect communication

**Source Day Transcript Integration:**
- MUST use the provided source day transcript above as your foundation
- Enhance the EXACT scenarios from the transcript - do not create new ones
- Maintain the SAME character names, settings, and story flow
- Keep the SAME scene headers and dialogue sequence
- Replace English phrases from source with sophisticated Filipino equivalents
- Preserve the story structure while elevating the language complexity

**Source Content Integration Requirements:**
- Build upon themes from Day {source_day} with enhanced sophistication
- Reference source day vocabulary while introducing advanced alternatives
- Maintain scenario familiarity while increasing language complexity

**Pedagogical Priority:**
- Primary: Smooth progression (comprehensible i+1)
- Secondary: Gradual authenticity increase
- NEVER sacrifice comprehensibility for maximum authenticity

**Authenticity Progression Logic:**
- Gradual increase in complexity while maintaining comprehensibility
- Replace English phrases with authentic Tagalog equivalents
- Enhance formality levels and cultural appropriateness
- Introduce native speech patterns and conversational flow

**SRS Integration:**
- Block English phrases when Filipino equivalent exists in SRS
- Example: If SRS contains "magandang umaga", NEVER use "good morning"

**SRS Vocabulary Building Constraints:**
- Incorporate ALL provided review collocations naturally
- New collocations should build logically on source day vocabulary
- Avoid overwhelming learners with too many new concepts
- Balance new learning with reinforcement of existing knowledge

**DEEPER Enhancement Examples:**

**Basic Level (Source Day):** 
"Excuse me, where is the bathroom?"
"Saan po ang CR?"

**DEEPER Level (Enhanced):**
"Paumanhin po, saan kaya ang palikuran dito?"
(More formal, uses "kaya" for politeness, "palikuran" instead of "CR")

**Basic Level:**
"How much is this?"
"Magkano po ito?"

**DEEPER Level:**
"Paumanhin po, ano pong presyo nito?"
(More formal opening, "presyo" instead of "magkano" for sophisticated register)

**Basic Level:**
"Thank you."
"Salamat po."

**DEEPER Level:**
"Maraming salamat sa inyo po."
(More elaborate gratitude, includes "sa inyo" for respect)

**Content Generation Instructions:**

1. **Use Source Transcript as Template:** Take the provided source day transcript and use it as your exact foundation
2. **Preserve Structure:** Keep the same scene headers, character names, and dialogue flow
3. **Enhance Language:** Replace basic phrases with sophisticated Filipino equivalents
4. **Maintain Comprehensibility:** Ensure enhancements feel natural and achievable for learners
5. **Cultural Authenticity:** Incorporate Filipino social patterns and communication styles

**Enhancement Approach:**
- **Same scenario:** Hotel check-in → Enhanced hotel check-in (not new restaurant scene)
- **Same characters:** If source uses "Maria" and "Carlos", keep "Maria" and "Carlos"  
- **Same flow:** If source has 3 scenes, enhanced version has 3 scenes in same order
- **Enhanced language:** "Good morning" → "Magandang umaga po" → "Magandang umaga po sa inyo"

**Quality Validation Checklist:**
- ✓ Uses source day transcript as exact structural foundation
- ✓ Maintains same characters, scenes, and dialogue flow from source
- ✓ Uses 8-12 sophisticated collocations
- ✓ Demonstrates enhanced Filipino authenticity
- ✓ Maintains comprehensibility despite complexity increase
- ✓ Incorporates all review vocabulary naturally
- ✓ Shows cultural awareness in language choices
- ✓ Blocks English when Filipino equivalent exists in SRS
- ✓ Enhanced content is recognizably the same story as source day
