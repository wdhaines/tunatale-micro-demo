        "content": "**The School Project**\n\nSophie had to do a science project for school. She needed to choose a topic and give a presentation to her class. Sophie didn't know what to choose.\n\n\"I know flowers and trees,\" Sophie thought, \"but everyone will do projects about normal plants.\"\n\nHer older sister Emma was home from university for the weekend. \"I want to tell you about something I learned in my biology class,\" Emma said. \"Come to my room.\"\n\nEmma opened her laptop and showed Sophie some pictures. \"Look at this,\" she said, pointing to a strange plant on the screen.\n\nSophie looked closely. The plant had leaves that looked like they could snap shut. \"What kind of plant is that?\"\n\n\"These are plants that eat insects,\" Emma explained. \"They're called carnivorous plants.\"\n\nSophie was amazed. \"Plants that eat things? How do they do that?\"\n\nEmma clicked on another picture. \"The ones with cup-shaped leaves are pitcher plants. Bugs fall in and can't get out. These other ones catch small bugs with sticky leaves.\"\n\nSophie watched a video of a Venus flytrap. When an insect touched the inside, the leaves would snap shut quickly.\n\n\"This is perfect for my project!\" Sophie said excitedly.\n\nEmma helped Sophie find more information. They learned that these plants live in places where the soil doesn't have enough food, so they have to catch insects instead.\n\nSophie worked hard on her project all week. She made colorful posters and practiced her presentation.\n\nOn presentation day, Sophie's classmates were very interested. They had never heard of plants that eat bugs before.\n\n\"Where do these plants live?\" one student asked.\n\n\"How fast can they snap shut?\" asked another.\n\nSophie answered all their questions confidently. Her teacher gave her an A+ for the most creative project in the class.",
