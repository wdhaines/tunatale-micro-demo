        "content": "Emma's Discovery\nEmma loved visiting the botanical garden with her grandfather every Saturday. She knew all the flowers and trees in the regular sections. Today, her grandfather took her to a new greenhouse.\n\"I want to tell you about a special place,\" her grandfather said as they walked inside.\nThe greenhouse was warm and humid. Emma saw many plants she had never seen before. Some had colorful flowers, others had unusual shapes.\n\"Grandpa, what are those?\" Emma asked, pointing to some plants near the window.\nHer grandfather smiled. \"Those are very strange plants, Emma. They're different from all the other plants we know.\"\nEmma moved closer to get a better look. One plant had leaves that looked like little cups. Another had leaves covered in tiny, shiny drops.\n\"Look at this one,\" her grandfather said, showing Emma a plant with leaves that had two parts. \"Watch what happens when I touch it.\"\nHe gently touched the inside of the leaf with a small stick. Suddenly, the leaf snapped shut!\nEmma's eyes went wide. \"How did it do that?\"\n\"These are plants that eat insects,\" her grandfather explained. \"They catch bugs and eat them for food.\"\nEmma couldn't believe it. \"Plants that eat things? Really?\"\n\"Yes, really. The cup-shaped ones are called pitcher plants. Bugs fall into the cups and can't get out. The ones with shiny drops are sundews - the drops are sticky and trap insects. And this one that snaps shut is a Venus flytrap.\"\nEmma stared at the very strange plants in amazement. She had learned about many plants before, but never plants that eat!\n\"Can I come back next week to see them again?\" Emma asked.\n\"Of course,\" her grandfather said. \"There's so much more to learn about these amazing plants.\"",
