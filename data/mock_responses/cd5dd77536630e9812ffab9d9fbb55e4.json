        "content": "**Ben's First Swimming Lesson**\n\nBen was eight years old and afraid of water. All his friends could swim, but Ben always stayed on the beach when they went to the pool.\n\n\"I want to learn to swim,\" Ben told his mother.\n\nHis mother smiled. \"Let's find you a swimming teacher.\"\n\nThe next week, Ben met his instructor, Miss Kelly. She was kind and patient.\n\n\"We'll start slowly,\" Miss Kelly said. \"First, let's get used to the water.\"\n\nBen stepped into the shallow end of the pool. The water felt cold around his legs.\n\n\"Now put your face in the water for just one second,\" Miss Kelly said.\n\nBen was scared, but he tried. He held his breath and put his face down. The water covered his nose and eyes. He quickly lifted his head up.\n\n\"Great job!\" Miss Kelly said.\n\nEvery week, Ben learned something new. He learned to float on his back. He learned to kick his legs. He learned to move his arms.\n\nThe hardest part was putting it all together. Ben had to kick, move his arms, and breathe at the same time.\n\nAfter two months, Ben swam across the pool without help.\n\n\"I did it!\" he shouted happily.\n\nNow Ben loves swimming. He goes to the pool with his friends every weekend.",
