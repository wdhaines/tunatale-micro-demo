        "content": "**The Swamp Adventure**\n\nMaya's uncle decided to take her on a special trip. \"I want to show you something amazing in the swamp,\" he said.\n\nMaya wasn't excited. She didn't like muddy places. But her uncle was a biologist, and he always had interesting ideas.\n\nThey put on tall boots and walked into the swamp. The ground was soft and wet under their feet. Maya could see plants everywhere, but they looked different from the gardens she knew.\n\n\"I know flowers from our garden at home,\" Maya said. \"But these plants look strange.\"\n\nHer uncle smiled. \"That's because these plants live in wet places like this swamp. They're special.\"\n\nThey walked carefully through the water until her uncle stopped. \"Look at these,\" he said, pointing to some unusual plants.\n\nMaya looked closely. The plants have leaves that were shaped like small cups. Other plants have shapes that looked like tiny umbrellas covered in sparkling drops.\n\n\"These plants are very interesting,\" her uncle explained. \"They don't get food the same way as normal plants.\"\n\n\"What do you mean?\" Maya asked.\n\n\"These plants need to eat insects to survive. They catch small bugs in different ways.\"\n\nMaya watched as a small fly landed on one of the cup-shaped plants. It fell inside and couldn't get out.\n\n\"The plant will eat that fly,\" her uncle said. \"In this swamp, the soil doesn't have enough nutrients, so the plants have to catch their own food.\"\n\nMaya looked around with new eyes. Now she could see plants with many different leaf shapes, all designed to catch insects.\n\n\"This is actually really cool,\" Maya said.\n\nHer uncle laughed. \"I knew you'd find them fascinating once you learned how they work.\"",
